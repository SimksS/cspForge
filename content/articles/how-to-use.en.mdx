A step-by-step guide to creating a robust Content Security Policy for your website.
<Section>
## Step 1: Select a Preset

Start with a baseline security level. You can choose from three presets:

### Strict

Provides the highest level of security. It restricts most resources to be loaded from the same origin ('self'). This is recommended for most applications.

### Balanced

A more moderate policy that allows loading resources from 'self', over HTTPS, and from data URIs. Good for sites that use external APIs or CDNs.

### Permissive

Allows loading resources from any source ('\*'). This is the least secure option and should be used with caution, primarily for development or simple websites with no user data.

## Step 2: Configure Sources

Specify the allowed domains and sources for your content.

In the "Configure Sources" section, you can add custom URLs for your scripts, styles, images, and other resources. For example, if you use Google Fonts, you would add `'https://fonts.googleapis.com'` and `'https://fonts.gstatic.com'`. You can also remove any source by clicking the 'X' button next to it.

## Step 3: Toggle Directives

Fine-tune your policy by enabling or disabling specific directives.

Directives control where resources can be loaded from. Each switch corresponds to a CSP directive (e.g., `script-src`, `style-src`). Toggle them based on your application's needs. Disabling a directive that your preset enabled will make your policy more restrictive for that resource type.

## Step 4: Use the Generated CSP

Your CSP is ready! Now, implement it in your application.

The generated CSP will appear in the "Generated CSP" box on the right. Click the copy button to copy it to your clipboard.

You can implement the CSP in two ways:

#### 1\. HTTP Header (Recommended)

This is the most secure method. Configure your web server to send a `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header with the generated policy as its value.

#### 2\. Meta Tag

Alternatively, you can add a meta tag to the `<head>` section of your HTML pages:  
`<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="...">`Replace "..." with your copied CSP. Note that some directives like `frame-ancestors` are not supported via meta tags.
